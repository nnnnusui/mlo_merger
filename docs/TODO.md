## Resource Conversion Tests

- [x] Extract local YMAP/YBN/YMT/YND/YTYP fixtures into `asset/sample` with source manifests.
- [x] Generate individual export and rebuild tests under `src/core/format/gamefile/test`.
- [x] Compare Native and CodeWalker exports and rebuilds; report byte identity separately.
- [x] Isolate expensive rebuilds with per-fixture time limits and produce JSON summaries.
- [ ] Resolve the remaining YBN export/rebuild differences and generate acceleration trees.
- [ ] Support the YTYP META array cases rejected by the current Native adapters.
- [ ] Investigate reference YMAP schema errors and the LOD-light hash rebuild discrepancy.
- [ ] Investigate YMT cases that CodeWalker cannot export; cover additional binary families as supported.
